# CPU Power Limiter
  
This tool can set the upper limit of CPU usage manually.
By doing so, you can reduce battery drain.

For example, if you do not need much CPU power like text input,  
lowering the upper limit of CPU usage rate can reduce battery drain.

Note: If you set the upper limit of CPU usage lower, PC processing will be slower.

This software may not work on all PCs.
It worked on the following models.
- Surface Pro 4 (Windows 10)
- MacBook Pro (Mid 2015) (Windows 10 on BootCamp)
- GPD Pocket (Windows 10)
